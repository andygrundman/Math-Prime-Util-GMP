- prime_count - needs the pc(#) option as well as pc(#,#)

- Do a GMP version of LMO prime_count.  Possible versions:
    - 32-bit main, 16-bit support
    - 64-bit main, 32-bit support   (using __uint64_t if necessary)
    - 128-bit main, 64-bit support  (gcc only)
    - GMP main, 32-bit support      (portable)
    - GMP main, 64-bit support      (mostly portable)

- nth_prime

- GMP SQUFOF could use a better implementation, though low priority since it
  just isn't going to be the right algorithm for numbers > 2^64.  Mainly what
  it needs is to pay attention to the rounds argument.  Perhaps race.

- Add Riemann R function

- Tune and improve SIMPQS for our uses.  Check FLINT 2.3 for improvements.

- Write our own QS.

- The statics in ecm and QS won't play well with threading.

- ECPP: Perhaps more HCPs/WCPs could be loaded if needed?

- ECPP: Another idea is related to Atkin/Morain's EAS.  When we have a large
  number, we can process more Ds, delaying the downrun.  We then use the
  smallest q we found.  Combine with lightened stage 1 factoring as above.
  This drops our q sizes faster, at the expense of more up-front time.
  I have this running, but for small numbers it doesn't matter much, and for
  large numbers it just highlights how much nicer FAS would be.

- ECPP: All discriminants with D % 8 != 3 have been converted to Weber.  We're
  still left with lots of those D values.  Figure out a different invariant
  that will make smaller polynomials, along with a root conversion.

- ECPP: Add a fast BLS5 to downrun?

- Add BLS17 proof.  Merge into BLS5 code since the end is the same.

- Add tests for proofs, similar to MPU t/23.

- Handle objects of type:
     Math::GMP
     Math::GMP::Fast
     Math::GMPz
  We should parse their mpz_t directly, do our processing, and output the
  result as one of these types.

- Recognize Math::BigInt / Math::Pari objects.  Shortcut validation.
  Create results as new objects of their type.

- These functions should be added:
     legendre_phi
     znlog

- Any fast primality pretest would be nice.  I've tested:
    - Colin Plumb's Euler Criterion test
    - Fermat base 210, which is done in GMP's internal millerrabin.c.
    - Fermat base 2 also no faster than SPRP-2, though some claim it is.
      mpz_t e, r;  int composite;
      mpz_init(e);
      mpz_init_set_ui(r, 2);  mpz_sub_ui(e, n, 1);  mpz_powm(r, r, e, n);
      composite = mpz_cmp_ui(r, 1) != 0;
      mpz_clear(r); mpz_clear(e);
      if (composite) return 0;
  None of these are faster on average than just doing BPSW.

- merge the two frobenius tests.  cp is faster, needs the deterministic
  version, we should switch to the two input version (allow GMP), etc.

- New version of Pi code using Chudnovsky.  See Pari.

- tests for sieve_primes.
  speed up range sieving.
  time mpu 'use bigint; my $n = 10**20; say join "\n",Math::Prime::Util::GMP::sieve_primes($n,$n+8e9,0);' >foo
  takes ~35 minutes.  NewPGen can do it in less than 4.  At 10^22 it is closer.

- More efficient version of ramanujan_tau?

- Consider ranged ramanujan_tau.  See:
  https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL13/Lygeros/lygeros5.pdf
  Where we could compute a number of hclassno values, then generate the
  tau values.  This might be more efficient.

- Frobenius test checks if the input is a perfect square.  We shouldn't.

- We could do LLR and Proth in prob_prime and return 1 instead of 2, leaving
  certs possible.

- is_frobenius_pseudoprime using a specified equation has issues with
  a single small prime (different for each P,Q combo).  The non-GMP has
  a similar issue.  e.g.:
  mpu 'forprimes { die $_ unless is_frobenius_pseudoprime($_,37,-13) } 1e6'

- cluster sieve tests
- More tuning and possible speedups for cluster sieve.
