- prime_count - needs the pc(#) option as well as pc(#,#)

- nth_prime

- We should have a native-int factoring module that works on any native-size
  composites.  Given that we'll already have done trial division, I'm thinking
  perhaps a good SQUFOF.

- GMP SQUFOF could use a better implementation, though low priority since it
  just isn't going to be the right algorithm for numbers > 2^64.  Mainly what
  it needs is to pay attention to the rounds argument.  Perhaps race.
