Revision history for Perl extension Math::Prime::Util::GMP

0.04  30 October 2012
    - Add simple prime_count function.  It uses next_prime so is terribly slow
      for big ranges.  It's a lot faster than the PP code when given a large
      base and small range e.g. (10**96, 10**96 + 2**18).
    - Add primorial, pn_primorial, and consecutive_integer_lcm functions.
    - Add a perfect power test for factoring.
    - Add a quick and dirty Pocklington primality test, so is_prime will
      return 2 (definitely prime) for many numbers in the 2^64 to 2^160 range.
      It will never mark a probable prime as a composite.
    - Add simple ECM factoring, adjust general factor() mix.

    - XS callable: _lcm_of_consecutive_integers(B)
      which is a better alternative for B! for many factoring algorithms.
    - Fix some minor compile issues.

    - Factoring tests assumed 64-bit.  Rewrite.

    - Initial release
